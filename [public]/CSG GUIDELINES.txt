- Think reasonably about how you will call functions or events. Don't give them unclear or silly names, but try to follow the pattern MTA is using.
- No unneeded security checks. When a function can only be called by a player, dont check if the element is a player.
- We are trying to avoid elementdata and use synced tables instead. Just trigger the client or server respectively to update their data.
- Don' t synchronize data when there's no need to. Try to make as much as possible with clientside scripts.
- Heavy scripts should be optimized for performance. Consider about what really needs to be called a lot.
- The kind of data that will hardly change when the script is running don't need to be synced alot. Only change data when its actually changed.
- Use proper indentation.
- Dont make functions when you dont really need these. Try keeping functions inside the eventhandler without making a seperate function for it.
- Generally follow the style of the code that already exists in the resource you're working in.
